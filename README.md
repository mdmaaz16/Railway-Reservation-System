**Railway Reservation System**
**Overview**
The Railway Reservation System is a Java-based application that allows administrators and passengers to manage train reservations efficiently. The system offers a range of functionalities for both admins and passengers, with real-time updates on train availability, booking information, and seat management. Data is stored and retrieved using a file-based storage system.

**Features**
**Admin Features:**
Add, Delete, and Update Train Details: Admins can manage the train database by adding new trains, updating existing train information, and removing outdated or canceled trains.
View Passenger Information: Admins have the ability to view detailed information about passengers who have booked tickets on specific trains.

**Passenger Features:**
View Available Trains: Passengers can search and view all available trains, along with details such as departure time, destination, and seat availability.
Book Tickets and Manage Reservations: Passengers can book tickets, select seats, and manage their reservations. Seat availability is updated in real-time to ensure accurate booking.
Dummy Payment System: A simulated payment system is implemented to handle booking costs. Passengers can calculate the total booking cost and simulate payment for their reservations. Seat availability is updated after a successful payment.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Java
Data Storage: File-based data storage for managing train and passenger details.
Payment Simulation: A dummy payment system to handle ticket pricing and simulate payment transactions.
